    <p>The purported Vivo X200 FE will reportedly launch in China as the Vivo S30 Pro Mini.</p>
    <img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/vivo_x200_pro_mini_vivo_1745586705907.jpg?downsize=950:*" alt="phone" width="1200">
    <ul>
        <p><i><b>HIGHLIGHTS</b></i></p>
        <li><i>Vivo X200 FE may have a 6.31-inch 120Hz 1.5K LTPO OLED screen</i></li>
        <li><i>The handset may pack two 50-megapixel rear cameras</i></li>
        <li><i>The Vivo X200 FE will likely support 90W fast charging</i></li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Vivo X200 FE could arrive in India in place of the Vivo X200 Pro Mini, which was unveiled in China in October 2024, alongside the base and Pro variants. The latter two were introduced in India last December. The Vivo X200 Pro Mini and X200 Ultra variants were previously tipped to come to the country. A recent report claims that the company may launch an FE variant in the country, in place of the X200 Pro Mini model, and that it could still be accompanied by the Vivo X200 Ultra. <br>

       <b>Vivo X200 FE India Launch Timeline, Features (Expected)</b>  <br>
        Smartprix reports that the Vivo X200 FE is expected to launch in India in by the end of June, or the beginning of July. The handset is said to make its debut in the country instead of the Vivo X200 Pro Mini, which was previously tipped to debut alongside the Vivo X200 Ultra model. <br>
        
        The rumoured addition to the Vivo X200 series is expected to be powered by a Dimensity 9400e SoC, which is an unannounced chip, and might be a binned version of the Dimensity 9400 chipset. Notably, the Vivo X200 Pro Mini features a MediaTek Dimensity 9400 SoC. In China, the handset is priced at CNY 4,699 (roughly Rs. 56,000) for the 12GB+256GB variant.</p>

        <h2>Sony Xperia 1 VII Design, Colourways Reportedly Spotted via Live Images on Taiwan's NCC Website</h2>
        <p>The purported Vivo X200 FE will reportedly launch in China as the Vivo S30 Pro Mini.</p>
        <img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/sony_xperia_1_vii_1743651281310.jpg?downsize=950:*" alt="phone" width="1200">
        <ul>
            <p><i><b>HIGHLIGHTS</b></i></p>
            <li><i>Sony Xperia 1 VII will be reportedly 165mm tall and 74mm wide</i></li>
            <li><i>The renders show three cameras in the back</i></li>
            <li><i>Sony Xperia 1 VI came in Black, Platinum Silver, and Khaki Green shades</i></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sony Xperia 1 VI was launched in May 2024 with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC and triple rear cameras. Now, Sony appears to be gearing up to release the Xperia 1 VII as the successor to last year's Xperia 1 VI. A publication spotted a new Sony handset on Taiwan's National Communications Commission (NCC) website, and the listing reveals the design and colour options of the the purported Sony Xperia 1 VII. It is said to be associated with the model number XQ-FSxx. The renders show three cameras in the back and a headphone jack. <br>

        <b>Sony Xperia 1 VII Design Leaked</b>  <br>
        Japanese website Sumaho Digest shared live images of the purported Sony Xperia 1 VII. The images that seem to have been sourced from the Taiwanese certification site NCC show the phone in black, navy green and purple colour options. For comparison, the Sony Xperia 1 VI arrived in Black, Platinum Silver, and Khaki Green colour options.
        <img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/sony_xperia_1_vii_sumaho_digest_1745589009144.jpg" alt="mobile pic" width="1200"> 
        <p>The renders show the Xperia 1 VII with minimal design changes compared to its predecessor. Sony appears to be sticking to a triple rear camera setup for the new phone, and the sensors are arranged vertically on the rear panel. The headphone jack, which is also present on the existing model, is also visible in the image. 
             <br>
            The leaked images suggest that the main camera of the phone, located in the centre, will be equipped with an Exmor-T sensor. The handset bears model number XQ-FSxx, according to the publication.
             <br>
            The report states that the Sony Xperia 1 VII will be 165mm tall and 74mm wide. This dimension could make the new phone a little longer than the Sony Xperia 1 VI, which is 162mm tall and 74mm in width.
             <br>
            A recent leak from earlier this month claimed that the Sony Xperia 1 VII will sport the same 6.5-inch screen as the Xperia 1 VI, with large bezels at both ends. It is likely to be the first Sony smartphone to run on a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.</p>
